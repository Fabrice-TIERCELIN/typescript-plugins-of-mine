# input-ui-ipc-provider-vscode

vscode Editor support for generic GUI data inquire through https://github.com/cancerberoSgx/typescript-plugins-of-mine/tree/master/input-ui-ipc-provider

Particularly, This will help my TypeScript plugins to inquire the user for data visually in TypeScript before refactoring the code. For example, ask the user in which class he wants to move a certain method. 

This will keep my plugins editor/IDE agnostic while the user experience is acceptable and visual. 

Probably this package should be installed together with the ts plugins
