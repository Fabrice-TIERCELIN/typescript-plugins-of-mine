# typescript-ast-util

**IMPORTANT**: a lot of objectives of this project were implemented in ts-simple-ast so it's kind of obsolete. 

I feel that I'm collecting utilities used in several plugins so I'm putting them in this project. 

[See apidocs](../docs/typescript-ast-util/modules/_index_.html)


# TODO

 * remove shelljs dependency so we can use this in the browser
 * rename / alias findChild to findDescendant
 * remove / investigate / rename / better jssdoc for findChild2()
 * document createProgram and other utilities
 * add example in ts-api playground
