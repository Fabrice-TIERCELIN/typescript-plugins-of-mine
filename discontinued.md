**Discontinued / Research**

I'm not currently working on this anymore. In the reality I tried to each my own shit in vscode and was a pain. I don't think it even  work since many versions have passed. 

I would LOVE to see someone working on improving this. These kind of tools could make the difference for a programmer. Writhing code could be ugly if you posses a disability like being drunk or high. 

So feel free to retake this if you like.

Also I would love to see more documentation regarding this topic, with more variable list of examples like this project contains. I hope it helps for  education purposes at least. 

Finally I would like to see this working on mono repos (moving a types.ts file from one project to another without having `export * `on the first one

I see this is being tackled by TypeScript team gradually, I just wanted to see this right now. 

That was my "dear reyes magos" letter :)
